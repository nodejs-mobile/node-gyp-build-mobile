# node-gyp-build-mobile

Fork of [node-gyp-build](https://github.com/prebuild/node-gyp-build) to override npm defaults, allowing [node-mobile-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile-gyp) to run.

## Versioning

Not following Semver, instead a `x.y.z-a` version means that we are forking node-gyp-build version `x.y.z`, where `a` is incremented as we publish versions.
